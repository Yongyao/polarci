The Polar CI Portal is a one stop portal that makes it easy for users to discover and access polar-related geospatial resources available across different online environments. In general, (1) a lightweight web engine framework is developed to search geospatial resources; (2) a data warehouse is built to harvest, store, search, and distribute geospatial information; (3) a harvesting middleware is established to harvest data from different online environments and convert them into formats that data warehouse supports; (4) a semantic-based query statement refinement is proposed to improve recall level and precision; (5) sophisticated functionalities (e.g. service quality monitoring and polar viewer) are used as a means of improving user experience and assisting decision-making; (6) a quality of service engine is used to provide users with service quality information, and (7) virtualized resources within Amazon EC2 are leveraged to support high performance search experience.
