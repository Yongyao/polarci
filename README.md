The Polar CI Portal is a one stop portal that makes it easy for users to discover and access polar-related geospatial resources available across different online environments. Specifically, it includes a few key features: 
* A lightweight web engine framework is developed to search geospatial resources; 
* A data warehouse is built to harvest, store, search, and distribute geospatial information; 
* A harvesting middleware is established to harvest data from different online environments and convert them into formats that data warehouse supports; 
* A semantic-based query statement refinement is proposed to improve recall level and precision; 
* Sophisticated functionalities (e.g. service quality monitoring and polar viewer) are used as a means of improving user experience and assisting decision-making; 
* A quality of service engine is used to provide users with service quality information
